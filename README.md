# LLJV-MusicApp
This is a music app created by the team LLJV. It was nearly wholly developed by Victoria Vanlue, with sparse contributions from Lauren Gladney and Laurin. The app will allow users to sign in, compose and share music, listen to others' publicly posted songs, and learn about the piano through mini lessons.
